## 1. USB Microphone System Analysis

This section explains the analog front-end of a USB microphone setup and its role in signal conditioning and conversion.

**System Overview**:

- **MEMS Microphone (SPH8878LR5H-1)**: Captures sound and outputs an analog voltage signal.
- **Amplification & Filtering**: The analog signal passes through a coupling capacitor and resistor, then enters an op-amp (OPA344) for amplification and noise filtering.
- **Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC)**: The conditioned analog signal is fed into an Arduino’s 10-bit ADC.
- **Digital Processing and USB Output**: The microcontroller processes the data and outputs it as USB-MIDI to a host device.

> 🎧 This design enables real-time conversion of sound into USB-MIDI digital data using analog IC techniques.
